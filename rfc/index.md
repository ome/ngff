Requests for comments (RFCs) are used to discuss and capture
high-level decisions within the NGFF community. Throughout
the [specifications](../specifications/index),
RFCs are referenced to provide readers background reading
and additional details.

The RFC process itself is defined as [RFC-1](1/index.md).
Key sections include:

* [Stakeholders](1/index.md#stakeholders)
* [DRAFT](1/index.md#draft)
* [RFC](1/index.md#rfc)
* [SPEC](1/index.md#spec)
* [Policies](1/index.md#policies)

If you are interested in submitting an RFC, start with the
introduction under ["Proposal"](1/index.md#proposal). Once you
are convinced that your RFC is on topic, within scope, and
has support from some members of the community, copy the
[RFC template](1/templates/rfc_template) to a new directory
and open a PR.

If there are any questions, please contact the editors under
