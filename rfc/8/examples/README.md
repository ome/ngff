# RFC-8 Examples

* `webknossos/custom-nodes.json`: A typical Webknossos collection with EM data, affinity prediction and segmentation as well as some custom nodes for meshes, segment index, agglomeration and connectome.
* `webknossos/inline-multiscale.json`: Same as `webknossos/custom-nodes.json` but with inlined multiscale metadata (non-standard, just as an experiment).
