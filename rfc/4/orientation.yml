description: >-
  This schema defines a standardized way to describe the axes of multidimensional image data. It allows each axis to 
  be clearly labeled (e.g., spatial, temporal, channel), assigned appropriate units (such as micrometers or seconds), 
  and, when relevant, include orientation information to specify the direction of measurement. The goal is to make 
  axis metadata explicit, consistent, and machine-readable—helping tools, datasets, and users work together seamlessly 
  and reduce ambiguity in data interpretation and processing.

  AxesNames:
    permissible_values:
      t: Axis name relating to the time axis.
      c: Axis name relating to the channel axis.
      z: Axis name relating to the z or depth axis.
      y: Axis relating to the y or height axis.

  AxisType:
    permissible_values:
      channel: >
        Represents distinct image acquisition channels, typically corresponding to different fluorescence markers, 
        stains, or detection modalities. Each channel captures a specific signal or wavelength, and the axis 
        distinguishes among them in the image data.
      space: >
        Denotes spatial dimensions of the image, such as physical axes in 2D or 3D (e.g., x, y, z). These axes map 
        directly to coordinates in the sample or scene and often have associated physical units like microns.
      time: >
        Represents a temporal axis capturing the progression of image data over time points or frames. 
        It is used in time-lapse imaging or dynamic studies to distinguish image slices acquired at different moments.
