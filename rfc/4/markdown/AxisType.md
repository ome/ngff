## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| channel | Represents distinct image acquisition channels, typically corresponding to different fluorescence markers, stains, or detection modalities. Each channel captures a specific signal or wavelength, and the axis distinguishes among them in the image data.
 |  |  |
| space | Denotes spatial dimensions of the image, such as physical axes in 2D or 3D (e.g., x, y, z). These axes map directly to coordinates in the sample or scene and often have associated physical units like microns.
 |  |  |
| time | Represents a temporal axis capturing the progression of image data over time points or frames. It is used in time-lapse imaging or dynamic studies to distinguish image slices acquired at different moments.
