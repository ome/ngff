## Community Calls
<p><font size="4">We are hosting community calls once every quarter at 9:00 CET and 17:00 CET. The same agenda is repeated in both time slots to allow participants around the globe to choose the one that fits their schedule best.

The Community Calls welcome everyone â€” developers, users, and enthusiasts alike. Whether you have just heard about OME-NGFF and are curious to learn more or if you have been working with it every day, consider yourself invited.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The next community call will be held in December (date to be announced soon). Please see the NGFF community calendar below for details and timings.</font></p>
