# Specifications

[Next-generation file format (NGFF) specifications](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/) for storing bioimaging data in the cloud.

Specifications have been moved to [ome/ngff-spec](https://github.com/ome/ngff-spec).

### Editing specifications

Specifications are written in markdown, or technically
[bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) -- a markdown document, with
special extensions understood by the bikeshed tool. The bikeshed tool is run
during the Sphinx build step (see conf.py).

# RFCs

Requests for comments (RFCs) are used to discuss and capture high-level decisions within the NGFF community. 

RFCs are contained under the `rfc` directory at the moment but may be moved out into a separate repo in the future.
